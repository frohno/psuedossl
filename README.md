# psuedossl
A simple - and probably insecure - not-quite-ssl implementation for Java

This was created for a sample project where proper certificates were not an option and no actual sensitive data was ever sent.

## Build
Download the Java library [here](https://github.com/frohno/psuedossl/releases)

## DISCLAIMERS:
First of all, read the [license](https://github.com/frohno/psuedossl/blob/master/LICENSE)!

Second, this is an amaturish attempt at recreating a pseudo SSL implementation. DO NOT THINK IT IS SECURE! Read up on SSL and use it if you plan to send actual sensetive data.
